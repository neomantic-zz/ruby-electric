This version of ruby electric is a fork of ruby-electric.el which includes a patch that enables it to work with the 
version of ruby-mode which now ships with Emacs 23.

The original version can be downloaded from here:
http://svn.joyent.com/opensource/dtrace/ruby/ruby-1.8.5/misc/ruby-electric.el

The joyent version of ruby-electric does not work with Emacs 23's ruby-mode.  It depends on a function of the original
ruby-mode - namely, ruby-insert-end - that is now missing from ruby-mode.
The problem and fix are described here:
http://groups.google.com/group/emacs-on-rails/browse_thread/thread/ae87fc797822bf3

This version of ruby-electric includes that fix.
